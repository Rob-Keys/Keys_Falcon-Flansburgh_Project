## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
```{r}
# Libraries
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
# Data import
Data <- read_csv('Data_Sheet_1_Comparing Mental Health of Athletes and Non-athletes as They Emerge From a COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown.csv')
head(Data)
```



```{r}
# Data cleanup
Data <- Data %>% filter(Data$`Emotional Wellbeing` < 999)
head(Data)

```

```{r}
# MLR, Emotional Wellbeing as response variable, I consider myself an athlete, most of my friends are athletes, and Sport is the most important part of my life as predictors
Emo_Data <- Data %>% select(`Emotional Wellbeing`, `I consider myself an athlete`, `most of my friends are athletes`, `Sport is the most important part of my life`)
Emo_Data <- Emo_Data %>% filter(`I consider myself an athlete` < 999)
Emo_Well_Fit <- lm(Emo_Data$`Emotional Wellbeing` ~ Emo_Data$`I consider myself an athlete` + Emo_Data$`most of my friends are athletes` + Emo_Data$`Sport is the most important part of my life`)
summary(Emo_Well_Fit)

```
